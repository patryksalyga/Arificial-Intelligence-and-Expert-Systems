##Fifteen Puzzle Solver
This project is a Python program designed to solve the Fifteen Puzzle using various state space search strategies:
Breadth-first search strategy;
Depth-first search strategy;
Best-first search strategy: A* with the following heuristics:
Hamming distance;
Manhattan distance.
The goal of this project is to provide an efficient and effective solution to the Fifteen Puzzle problem, demonstrating the power and versatility of various search algorithms and heuristics.
